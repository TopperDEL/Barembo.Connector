## The connector to Barembo

This library contains all Services, Interfaces and Models to connect to Barembo. Barembo is a secure Data-Store for diaries and memories. It uses Storj as it's backend, so you and only you control the data and have access to it.
The Barembo-Connector is primarily used by the Barembo-App, but may also be used by other Applications. It currently is a Work-in-process.

## Use

Search for "[Barembo.Connector](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Barembo.Connector)" on Nuget and install the latest version into your project.

## Build

Simply clone the repository and open it in Visual Studio. To run all tests you need an account on a Storj-satellite and provide an access grant. Further instructions on this will follow.
